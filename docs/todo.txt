To Do

To do
-----

- Push definitions out to individual modules.
- Integrate Austen's driver changes.
- Create nice and simple boiler-plate IOC builder example.
- Rename `hardware` to `components`?
- Rename `python/\_\_builder\_\_.py` to `builder/\_\_builder\_\_.py` or even
`builder/\_\_init\_\_.py`?
- Parse `configure/RELEASE` to validate version consitencies.  Actually need
entirely new VERSION mechanism!
- Suggestions from Austen:
. Fully commmented template build file (not quite sure what this means)
. Example `build.py` for each supported module.
- Review module export mechanism.  What do we export and when?  How about
automatically exporting all `ModuleBase` classes?
- Typo in `TimingTemplates` `decode.template`.

Functionality to extend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Want more `AsynSerial` configuration options -- see `AsynOctet` (TRAC #717).

- Ensure that `autosave` properly implements full autosave functionality
(check wiki).
- Looks as if `calc` is a bit incomplete!
- `seq` doesn't do a damned thing.

- Push `psc` from `pscBuilder/components/pscIp.py` to `psc` module.


Austen's Extensions
-------------------

All in `~ajr78/epics3.14/iocs` and subdirectories `pscBuilder` and
`idBuilder`.  Candidate files:

`pscBuilder/components/pscIp.py`::
Adds `ipmIrqCmd` to `Hy8002`.  Probably want to add this and other related
commands to `IpCarrier` class.
+
Declares `PSC` `IpDevice` together with associated templates `pcsTemplate`,
`pscFuGTemplate`, `Hy8401Template` (in `psc`!) and `LockTemplate`.  Looks
like `pscGroup` doesn't necessarly belong in the `psc` device.

`pscBuilder/components/pscTiming.py`::
Creates `TimingTemplates` based macros based on `evr_usec_calc` and `offset`
templates, presmably need to add to `TimingTemplates.py`.

`pscBuilder/components/IOCinfo.py`::
A copy of `IOCinfo.py`, now redundant.

`pscBuilder/components/pscAHU.py`::
Template definition `StulzAHUTemplate` for `StulzAHU` module.

`idBuilder/components/Hy8403.py`::
Redundant copy of `Hy8403`.

`idBuilder/components/idSupport.py`::
Class `ID` for `insertionDevice` module.  Probably needs a better name (as the
`components` namespace is widely shared).
+
Uses `seq`, but fakes it up!  Need to look at making the `seq` module work
properly.  Also defines replacement `seq` module.
+
Defines `HostLink`, `calc`, `sscan`, `ip`, `Thermocouple`, `PT100` modules.
+
Defines `AsynOctet` device which reimplements `AsynSerial`, but performs some
extra initialisation.  Need to move this into `AsynSerial` device.
+
Further definitions for `digitelMpc`, `mks937a`, `vacuumSpace`,
`insertionDevice`, `psc`, `Hy8403ip`, `PT100`.  For example, there are 20
templates in the `insertionDevice` module!

`idBuilder/components/IOCinfo.py`::
Redundant copy of `IOCinfo`.

`idBuilder/components/MAXv.py`::
`OmsMAXv` module.  Needs to be added to `motor` support module.  Need to check
how this interacts with the original `Oms` device, for example: can the cards
be mixed?

`idBuilder/components/Oms.py`::
Looks awfully like a copy of `Oms.py`.  Yes, it is: completely redundant,
fortunately.


Issues
------

Where do we manage the module globals?  Currently we have a rather tangled
approach: `__init__.py` defines `_globals()` to provide access to the module
globals, which is then injected into `Configure` as its private `__globals()`
method.  It also define `_add_symbol` which adds to globals and to `_epics`.





Goals
-----

- Remove as much complexity as possible.
- Implement dynamic loading of modules.  Done!
- Implement outstanding TRAC requests.  Done #344, #718.
