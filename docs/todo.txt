To do
-----

- EpicsBasePath currently in baselib -- this isn't right.
- Relocate `data` directory.  One suggestion is to put the `data` directory in
the IOC, and Austen would like the data to then be copied at make time.  (TRAC
#718).
- Suggestions from Austen:
. Fully commmented template build file (not quite sure what this means)
. Example `build.py` for each supported module.
- Change support macro names to be more consistent.  Nick suggests module name
in upper case (and with non identifier characters converted to underscores).
- Use macro names in generated makefiles (TRAC #344).
- Support `AsynOctec` (TRAC #717).
- Ensure that `autosave` properly implements full autosave functionality.
- Looks as if `calc` is a bit incomplete!

Current changes

Issues
------

Where do we manage the module globals?  Currently we have a rather tangled
approach: `__init__.py` defines `_globals()` to provide access to the module
globals, which is then injected into `Configure` as its private `__globals()`
method.  It also define `_add_symbol` which adds to globals and to `_epics`.

Currently we're importing `python/builder.py` or `data/builder.py`, but it
actually behaves just like a Python package -- this suggests that it might be
more honest to import `builder/__init__.py`!


Goals
-----

- Remove as much complexity as possible.
- Implement dynamic loading of modules.  Done!
- Implement outstanding TRAC requests.
