To Do

To do
-----

- EpicsBasePath currently in baselib -- this isn't right.
- Completely rename builder, to `ioc_builder` or something similar.


Current changes
---------------



Issues
------

Where do we manage the module globals?  Currently we have a rather tangled
approach: `__init__.py` defines `_globals()` to provide access to the module
globals, which is then injected into `Configure` as its private `__globals()`
method.  It also define `_add_symbol` which adds to globals and to `_epics`.


Goals
-----

- Remove as much complexity as possible.
- Implement dynamic loading of modules.
- Implement outstanding TRAC requests.
