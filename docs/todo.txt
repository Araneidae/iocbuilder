To do
-----

- Relocate `data` directory.  One suggestion is to put the `data` directory in
the IOC, and Austen would like the data to then be copied at make time.  (TRAC
#718).
- Suggestions from Austen:
. Fully commmented template build file (not quite sure what this means)
. Example `build.py` for each supported module.
- Support `AsynOctec` (TRAC #717).
- Ensure that `autosave` properly implements full autosave functionality.
- Looks as if `calc` is a bit incomplete!
- Integrate Austen's driver changes.
- Create nice and simple boiler-plate IOC builder example.
- Validate module names during ModuleVersion import -- or even replace
ModuleName in this context, as it's redudant!
- Rename `hardware` to `components`?
- Parse `configure/RELEASE` to validate version consitencies.  Actually need
entirely new VERSION mechanism!

Current changes
---------------

Changing `Hy8515` from 3-9 to 3-7 for `ipac` version consistency.  Need to see
what the changes are.


Issues
------

Where do we manage the module globals?  Currently we have a rather tangled
approach: `__init__.py` defines `_globals()` to provide access to the module
globals, which is then injected into `Configure` as its private `__globals()`
method.  It also define `_add_symbol` which adds to globals and to `_epics`.


Goals
-----

- Remove as much complexity as possible.
- Implement dynamic loading of modules.  Done!
- Implement outstanding TRAC requests.  Done #344.
