To Do
=====

To do
-----

- In `dbd.py` the `_DBD` class is pointless, as really it only wraps
`LoadDbdFile` -- rewrite this.


Current changes
---------------

- Removed resets.
- Added `iocinit.SetInitialLibrary`.
- Removed initial `Configure` call from `__init__.py`.  This means that the
builder cannot be used without being configured.
- Removed support for deleting symbols.
- Modified `iocwriter.DiamondIocWriter` to write only one IOC
- Trying to rework `configure` module.


Issues
------

Module import is currently completely tangled.


Goals
-----

- Remove as much complexity as possible.
- Implement dynamic loading of modules.
- Implement outstanding TRAC requests.
